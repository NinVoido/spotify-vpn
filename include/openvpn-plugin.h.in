 *
 * In addition, spotify_PLUGIN_FUNC_DEFERRED may be returned by

 * authentication where the plugin (or one of its agents) may indicate
 * authentication success/failure some number of seconds after the return
 * of the spotify_PLUGIN_AUTH_USER_PASS_VERIFY handler by writing a single
 * char to the file named by auth_control_file in the environmental variable
 * list (envp).
 *
 * first char of auth_control_file:
 * '0' -- indicates auth failure
 * '1' -- indicates auth success
 *
 * spotify will delete the auth_control_file after it goes out of scope.
 *
 * See sample/sample-plugins/defer/simple.c for an example on using
 * asynchronous authentication.
